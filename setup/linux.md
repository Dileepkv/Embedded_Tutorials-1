# Install Linux

Although you can program in Windows, I donâ€™t know how nor do I care for learning how to do so in order to teach others. You may be a die-hard Windows fan, but the truth is that Windows absolutely sucks for development.

I recommend using Ubuntu for people that are new to Linux, as it is easy to use right away. I've found that Ubuntu has its limitations, especially once you start to really customize your Linux experience.

If you truly want to be an elitist, I recommend using Arch Linux.
