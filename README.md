# Introduction To Embedded Development

Embedded development is the study of how to write software for microcontrollers or computers that serve a very specific purpose.
For example, a T.V. remote is programmed to output a series of IR pulses depending on which button is pressed.
It must do this repeatedly, using very little power, and should be extremely reliable.

This series of tutorials will talk about how to get started with embedded development.
In particular, we will be focused on embedded development using AVR chips (specifically the ATmega16m1 series). 
However, many of the things you learn through these tutorials will be applicable to other microcontrollers and systems.
